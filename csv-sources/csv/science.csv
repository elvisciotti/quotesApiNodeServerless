"In science, we must be interested in things, not in persons.",Marie Curie,science
"The mysteriousness and mystique of space is such, that science fiction attempts to tantalize you by telling you a story that could possibly be out there and that's the appeal of science fiction.",William Shatner,science

"I have seen the science I worshiped, and the aircraft I loved, destroying the civilization I expected them to serve.",Charles Lindbergh,science
"The major obstacle to a religious renewal is the intellectual classes, who are highly influential and tend to view religion as primitive superstition. They believe that science has left atheism as the only respectable intellectual stance.",Robert Bork,science

"I wasn't with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through science, and I will not permit so-called science to destroy it.",Thomas S. Monson,science
"The most watched programme on the BBC, after the news, is probably 'Doctor Who.' What has happened is that science fiction has been subsumed into modern literature. There are grandparents out there who speak Klingon, who are quite capable of holding down a job. No one would think twice now about a parallel universe.",Terry Pratchett,science

Science is all metaphor.,Timothy Leary,science

Definition of Statistics: The science of producing unreliable facts from reliable figures.,Evan Esar,science
God created the world the laws of nature were created by God. True science tries to find out what God put in the world. The trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they don't know what they're talking about because they weren't there. They can't speculate about the origins of life because they weren't there.,Pat Robertson,science
"There are in fact two things, science and opinion the former begets knowledge, the later ignorance.",Hippocrates,science
"I did, although I didn't read from page 1 to page 187 but I read chunks of it. I did a little bit of science when I was in the university so I was able to understand the graphs and pie charts and stuff like that. It was extremely dry.",Liam Neeson,science
Science knows only one commandment - contribute to science.,Bertolt Brecht,science

"Go beyond science, into the region of metaphysics. Real religion is beyond argument. It can only be lived both inwardly and outwardly.",Swami Sivananda,science
"I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama there's no device, It's just about a human being.",Jack Nicholson,science

Knowledge of the sciences is so much smoke apart from the heavenly science of Christ.,John Calvin,science
"Science fiction writers, I am sorry to say, really do not know anything. We can't talk about science, because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial, and usually our fiction is dreadful.",Philip K. Dick,science

Economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life. The result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scot-free and ignores the environmental cost.,Vivienne Westwood,science
"Making movies is not rocket science. It's about relationships and communication and strangers coming together to see if they can get along harmoniously, productively, and creatively. That's a challenge. When it works, it's fantastic and will lift you up. When it doesn't work, it's almost just as fascinating.",Julia Roberts,science

Science without conscience is the death of the soul.,Francois Rabelais,science
History is the science of things which are not repeated.,Paul Valery,science
"I also like to look at the dynamic that takes place between religion and science because, in a way, both are asking the same questions: Who are we? Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? The methodologies are diametrically opposed, but their motivation is the same the wellspring is the same in both cases.",J. Michael Straczynski,science

I started out writing much more science fictiony stuff and writing about science fiction.,Neil Gaiman,science

New discoveries in science will continue to create a thousand new frontiers for those who still would adventure.,Herbert Hoover,science
Art is I science is we.,Claude Bernard,science
"Our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality. This view of the world - biocentrism - revolves around the way a subjective experience, which we call consciousness, relates to a physical process. It is a vast mystery and one that I have pursued my entire life.",Robert Lanza,science
The No Child Left Behind Program was an incentive to the schools to get their kids up to snuff on math and science and reading.,Sandra Day O'Connor,science

"Nothing retains less of desire in art, in science, than this will to industry, booty, possession.",Andre Breton,science
We've made science experiments of ourselves and our children.,Jonathan Safran Foer,science

"Rocket science is tough, and rockets have a way of failing.",Sally Ride,science
Science is fun. Science is curiosity. We all have natural curiosity. Science is a process of investigating. It's posing questions and coming up with a method. It's delving in.,Sally Ride,science
"Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science, environmental management, government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.",James Buchan,science
"Humanity has experienced many revolutionary changes over the course of history: revolutions in agriculture, in science, industrial production, as well as numerous political revolutions. But these have all been limited to the external aspects of our individual and collective lives.",Daisaku Ikeda,science
"The most important thing we can do is inspire young minds and to advance the kind of science, math and technology education that will help youngsters take us to the next phase of space travel.",John Glenn,science
Science always uses metaphor.,James Lovelock,science
"If you start any large theory, such as quantum mechanics, plate tectonics, evolution, it takes about 40 years for mainstream science to come around. Gaia has been going for only 30 years or so.",James Lovelock,science
"Fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science. I'm not religious, but I put it that way because I feel so strongly. It's the one thing you do not ever do. You've got to have standards.",James Lovelock,science
"What I like about sceptics is that in good science you need critics that make you think: 'Crumbs, have I made a mistake here?' If you don't have that continuously, you really are up the creek. The good sceptics have done a good service, but some of the mad ones I think have not done anyone any favours.",James Lovelock,science
"Faulkner is a writer who has had much to do with my soul, but Hemingway is the one who had the most to do with my craft - not simply for his books, but for his astounding knowledge of the aspect of craftsmanship in the science of writing.",Gabriel Garcia Marquez,science
"Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art.",Susan Sontag,science
This means that to entrust to science - or to deliberate control according to scientific principles - more than scientific method can achieve may have deplorable effects.,Friedrich August von Hayek,science
"True science is never speculative it employs hypotheses as suggesting points for inquiry, but it never adopts the hypotheses as though they were demonstrated propositions.",Cleveland Abbe,science
"Just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany, so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology.",Edward Thorndike,science
"The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality.",Shimon Peres,science
"It's time to let science and medicine, not politics and rhetoric, lead us to good, sound policy.",Eliot Spitzer,science
"Facts matter. Science matters. Reason matters. Mitt Romney has shown an inability to respect any of the three. President Barack Obama not only respects them, he relies on them. He is an overwhelming and unquestioned choice to continue as president.",Eliot Spitzer,science
"The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.",Lord Acton,science
The worst state of affairs is when science begins to concern itself with art.,Paul Klee,science
Politics is not an exact science.,Otto von Bismarck,science
"We have failed to protect science against speculative extensions of nature, continuing to assign physical and mathematical properties to hypothetical entities beyond what is observable in nature.",Robert Lanza,science

Everything is becoming science fiction. From the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century.,J. G. Ballard,science
"Science and technology multiply around us. To an increasing extent they dictate the languages in which we speak and think. Either we use those languages, or we remain mute.",J. G. Ballard,science

It is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing.,Norman Cousins,science
"To pursue science is not to disparage the things of the spirit. In fact, to pursue science rightly is to furnish the framework on which the spirit may rise.",Vannevar Bush,science
"Science will explain how but not why. It talks about what is, not what ought to be. Science is descriptive, not prescriptive it can tell us about causes but it cannot tell us about purposes. Indeed, science disavows purposes.",Jonathan Sacks,science
"In the post-enlightenment Europe of the 19th century the highest authority was no longer the Church. Instead it was science. Thus was born racial anti-Semitism, based on two disciplines regarded as science in their day - the 'scientific study of race' and the Social Darwinism of Herbert Spencer and Ernst Haeckel.",Jonathan Sacks,science
"Since Hiroshima and the Holocaust, science no longer holds its pristine place as the highest moral authority. Instead, that role is taken by human rights. It follows that any assault on Jewish life - on Jews or Judaism or the Jewish state - must be cast in the language of human rights.",Jonathan Sacks,science
"Dreaming in public is an important part of our job description, as science writers, but there are bad dreams as well as good dreams. We're dreamers, you see, but we're also realists, of a sort.",William Gibson,science
"I have a better internal and intuitive understanding of folklore and myth than science and technology, so in that way fantasy is easier.",Sarah Zettel,science
The purpose of science is not to analyze or describe but to make useful models of the world. A model is useful if it allows us to get use out of it.,Edward de Bono,science

It is sometimes important for science to know how to forget the things she is surest of.,Jean Rostand,science
"When a scientist is ahead of his times, it is often through misunderstanding of current, rather than intuition of future truth. In science there is never any error so gross that it won't one day, from some perspective, appear prophetic.",Jean Rostand,science
"I'm afraid for all those who'll have the bread snatched from their mouths by these machines. What business has science and capitalism got, bringing all these new inventions into the works, before society has produced a generation educated up to using them!",Henrik Ibsen,science
Those theologians who are beginning to take the doctrine of creation very seriously should pay some attention to science's story.,John Polkinghorne,science
"Much of today's public anxiety about science is the apprehension that we may forever be overlooking the whole by an endless, obsessive preoccupation with the parts.",Lewis Thomas,science
"I suggest that the introductory courses in science, at all levels from grade school through college, be radically revised. Leave the fundamentals, the so-called basics, aside for a while, and concentrate the attention of all students on the things that are not known.",Lewis Thomas,science
"The central task of science is to arrive, stage by stage, at a clearer comprehension of nature, but this does not at all mean, as it is sometimes claimed to mean, a search for mastery over nature.",Lewis Thomas,science
"Very few recognize science as the high adventure it really is, the wildest of all explorations ever taken by human beings, the chance to glimpse things never seen before, the shrewdest maneuver for discovering how the world works.",Lewis Thomas,science
"We're as clever as we think we are, but we'll be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains. We're at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems. We do it in science all the time - there's no reason why we can't do it in other endeavors.",Lewis Thomas,science
"I like fantasy. I like horror, science fiction because I can get avant-garde with those performances in those movies.",Nicolas Cage,science
The violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can only be understood when one realises that here the foundations of physics have started moving and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science.,Werner Heisenberg,science
"I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them.",Maya Lin,science
"Science fiction, to me, has not only things that wouldn't happen, but other planets.",Margaret Atwood,science
"This much we know: Journalism is not a precise science. It's, on its best day, is a crude art. We make mistakes I make mistakes. With more than 50 years as a journalist, I have at least had the opportunity to blow more stories, make more mistakes than maybe anybody in television.",Dan Rather,science
Nothing is less important than which fork you use. Etiquette is the science of living. It embraces everything. It is ethics. It is honor.,Emily Post,science

More and more NFL players have been willing their bodies to science so that their brains can be studied even if they die of other causes.,Jeffrey Kluger,science
"Science has yet to isolate the Godiva Chocolate or Prada gene, but that doesn't mean your weakness for pricey swag isn't woven into your DNA. According to a new study of identical twins, it's less TV ads or Labor Day sales that make you buy the things you do than the tastes and temperaments that are already part of you at birth.",Jeffrey Kluger,science
"The best thing about science is that hard, empirical answers are always there if you look hard enough. The best thing about religion is that the very absence of that certainty is what requires - and gives rise to - deep feelings of faith.",Jeffrey Kluger,science
"When I began in 1960, individuality wasn't an accepted thing to look for it was about species-specific behaviour. But animal behaviour is not hard science. There's room for intuition.",Jane Goodall,science
"Women tend to be more intuitive, or to admit to being intuitive, and maybe the hard science approach isn't so attractive. The way that science is taught is very cold. I would never have become a scientist if I had been taught like that.",Jane Goodall,science

"Traditionally, scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply 'given,' elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth, and fixed thereafter. Inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science.",Paul Davies,science
The birth of science as we know it arguably began with Isaac Newton's formulation of the laws of gravitation and motion. It is no exaggeration to say that physics was reborn in the early 20th-century with the twin revolutions of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.,Paul Davies,science

"Many writers upon the science of political economy have declared that it is the duty of a nation first to encourage the creation of wealth and second, to direct and control its distribution. All such theories are delusive.",Leland Stanford,science

Intelligence is not a science.,Frank Carlucci,science
"I certainly saw science as a kind of calling, and one with as much legitimacy as a religious calling.",Joshua Lederberg,science

"If modernist naturalism were true, there would be no objective truth outside of science. In that case right and wrong would be a matter of cultural preference, or political power, and the power already available to modernists ideologies would be overwhelming.",Phillip E. Johnson,science
"The problem with allowing God a role in the history of life is not that science would cease, but rather that scientists would have to acknowledge the existence of something important which is outside the boundaries of natural science.",Phillip E. Johnson,science

One of my degrees was a science degree in biology.,Elizabeth Moon,science
I was horrible at science and math. I couldn't pass a test to save my life! I'm surprised that it didn't take me until I was 20 to graduate. That's why my role is so cool - Grissom is the complete opposite of me.,William Petersen,science
"My personal feeling about science fiction is that it's always in some way connected to the real world, to our everyday world.",Elizabeth Moon,science

My dad always said I could be an engineer at that time it was the elite of society: steady job, working in science, which was then the answer to every problem we had. It was kind of a mandate. Kind of a dream he had for me.",James Wood,science
"I'm crazy about Grant: his character, his nature, his science in fighting and everything else.

"I do love science fiction, but it's not really a genre unto itself it always seems to merge with another genre. With the few movies I've done, I've ended up playing with genre in some way or another, so any genre that's made to mix with others is like candy to me. It allows you to use big, mythic situations to talk about ordinary things.",Rian Johnson,science
"A third ideal that has made its way in the modern world is reliance on reason, especially reason disciplined and enriched by modern science. An eternal basis of human intercommunication is reason.",Emily Greene Balch,science
It is characteristic of science that the full explanations are often seized in their essence by the percipient scientist long in advance of any possible proof.,John Desmond Bernal,science
"The recognition of the art that informs all pure science need not mean the abandonment for it of all present art, rather it will mean the completion of the transformation of art that has already begun.",John Desmond Bernal,science
