"A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day.",Jim Bishop,age
"Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism.

Francione,age
"I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on.",Lillie Langtry,age

"I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her.",Ellie Goulding,age
I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - 'I'm going to get married at this age I'm going to have a kid at this age' - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don't want my life to be based on that.,Julia Stiles,age

"My view is pensioners don't have the one option that people of working age have. They can't really increase their income, because they are no longer able to work.",Iain Duncan Smith,age
"Work is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you're of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not.",Iain Duncan Smith,age
"I think you can't really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it's New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can't escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of.",Jack White,age

I'm 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don't feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don't know that I'm necessarily an addict.,Lindsay Lohan,age
I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back.,Lindsay Lohan,age
"Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I'm actually overweight.",Lindsay Lohan,age

Age for me is just a number.,Haile Gebrselassie,age
"You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, 'You're a sellout, because you're doing something other than what you should be doing.'

Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think.,Maya Lin,age
"From an early age I didn't buy into the value systems of working hard in a nine-to-five job. I thought creativity, friendship and loyalty and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable was much more interesting.",Adam Clayton,age

"As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did.

"Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.",Clarence Day,age

"Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.",Aung San Suu Kyi,age
"When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn't just about me.

"My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that's true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.",George Saunders,age

"It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged.",Jane Fonda,age
"We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the old metaphor: You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.",Jane Fonda,age

The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I'm 19?,Fiona Apple,age
There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we're lifetime baby-making machines. Women's reproductive abilities start to wane when they're as young as 35. Men? We're good to go pretty much till we're dead.,Jeffrey Kluger,age
"Older fatherhood isn't all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who's just getting started.",Jeffrey Kluger,age
"Credit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic.",Jeffrey Kluger,age
"When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you've got an adolescent boy, you're in the sweet spot for trouble.",Jeffrey Kluger,age

"By age seven, I used to comb my hair for performances, just pull my hair up into a bun. Granted, it wasn't a very intricate hairstyle. Still, to be that responsible and disciplined at age seven is unusual.",Janet Jackson,age
"It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene.",Kathleen Turner,age
I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing.,Rupert Everett,age
"Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you.",Rupert Everett,age

"I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it.

So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut.",Garrett Hedlund,age
"If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I'm a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.",Katherine Jenkins,age

Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can't really control life - so you'd better live it while it's here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.,Jon Hamm,age
"Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses.",Maggie Kuhn,age

"I don't look my age, I don't feel my age and I don't act my age. To me age is just a number.",Joan Collins,age

"From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine.",Gary Vaynerchuk,age
"IQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I'm far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read 'Tech Crunch,' 'Ad Age.'

I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can't help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it's taught writers.,David Mitchell,age
"Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections.",Dean Kamen,age
"I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can't be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it's so dangerous for kids. So there's a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids.",Tim McGraw,age
"In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we're now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals.",David Mitchell,age
