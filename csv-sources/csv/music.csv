"I don't really have a style icon but I really admire the way people dress like Gaga, Rihanna and Gwen Stefani.

I think the pop chart today is entirely market-driven. And it has nothing to do with public taste. And it has nothing to do with moving music forward. It's simply a market chart.,Steven Patrick Morrissey,music
"That's why this generation is the least racist generation ever. You see it all the time. Go to any club. People are intermingling, hanging out, having fun, enjoying the same music.

"I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing 'chick' music for teenage girls or something.

It's part of the cultural dynamic, I guess.",Ani DiFranco,music

"I see a lot of connections between folk and punk music just because they're both subcorporate music - I mean, traditionally.",Ani DiFranco,music
"I've been trying to learn how to not be so conflicted about things like my own anger. I've always had a place in my music for my anger as a way of compensating for not having a mechanism to express it in my everyday life. So I've been trying to be more true to myself, and that helps me to chill out a little bit. But politically, uh-uh. No.",Ani DiFranco,music
"Pop stardom is not very compelling. I'm much more interested in a relationship between performer and audience that is of equals.

"Music is emotional, and you may catch a musician in a very unemotional mood or you may not be in the same frame of mind as the musician. So a critic will often say a musician is slipping.",Nat King Cole,music

"I've programmed myself musically to come up with love-feeling tracks that are romantic, sexy, but classy, all in one. And that's the challenge. Once I create that music, then the lyrical content starts to come - you know, the stories and things like that.",R. Kelly,music

"Negro music and culture are intrinsically improvisational, existential. Nothing is sacred. After a decade, a musical idea, no matter how innovative, is threatened.",Archie Shepp,music
"Pop is a little bit theatrical. That's the whole vibe. That's the point - is that it's great music, great melodies, great hooks. But, on top of it, it's a presentation. There's a showmanship about it. And that's why I wanted to be a pop star.",Adam Lambert,music

"Music is a language and different people who come along are each using that language to do something different, but all coming at it in a similar vein inasmuch as it's always community based and for the most part nonprofit.

"For some reason, the evolutionists have not come up with an evolution-based explanation for why human beings react so powerfully to music. But surely they will.",Dennis Prager,music

And I think it takes a couple of listens to actually really get it.",Norah Jones,music
"Oh, stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look, I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music.

"I try to just make music that I love, and if I believe in it that's all that matters.",Norah Jones,music

"I find that it isn't wise to attempt to judge people on their public persona, and even on the music they make. Because I've met so many people whose music I cannot stand, and they're very nice.
