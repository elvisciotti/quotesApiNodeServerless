"Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.",Paul Rand,art
I don't have anything to say about other people's art and their work.,Dolly Parton,art
Patience is the art of concealing your impatience.,Guy Kawasaki,art
The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle.,Stanley Kubrick,art
"For his heart was in his work, and the heart giveth grace unto every art.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,art
Resolve and thou art free.,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,art
Art is a harmony parallel with nature.,Paul Cezanne,art
"Film as dream, film as music. No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls.",Ingmar Bergman,art
"I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few.",William Morris,art
"The style of ancient Egyptian art is transcendently clear, something 8-year-olds can recognize in an instant. Its consistency and codification is one of the most epic visual journeys in all art, one that lasts 30 dynasties spread over 3,000 years.",Jerry Saltz,art
Egotism: The art of seeing in yourself what others cannot see.,George V. Higgins,art
A work of art has no importance whatever to society. It is only important to the individual.,Vladimir Nabokov,art
I don't think any movie or any book or any work of art can solve the stalemate in the Middle East today. But it's certainly worth a try.,Steven Spielberg,art
I think that one's art is a growth inside one. I do not think one can explain growth. It is silent and subtle. One does not keep digging up a plant to see how it grows.,Emily Carr,art
It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.,W. H. Auden,art
"After a few months in my parents' basement, I took an apartment near the state university, where I discovered both crystal methamphetamine and conceptual art. Either one of these things are dangerous, but in combination they have the potential to destroy entire civilizations.",David Sedaris,art
"To know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living.",Herman Melville,art
I had wanted a tape recorder since I was tiny. I thought it was a magic thing. I never got one until just before I went to art school.,Brian Eno,art
"It is not hard to understand modern art. If it hangs on a wall it's a painting, and if you can walk around it it's a sculpture.",Tom Stoppard,art
Art is anything you can get away with.,Marshall McLuhan,art
Everything a writer learns about the art or craft of fiction takes just a little away from his need or desire to write at all. In the end he knows all the tricks and has nothing to say.,Raymond Chandler,art
Nature scarcely ever gives us the very best for that we must have recourse to art.,Baltasar Gracian,art
"To say nothing, especially when speaking, is half the art of diplomacy.",Will Durant,art
"Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.",David Herbert Lawrence,art
"Oh literature, oh the glorious Art, how it preys upon the marrow in our bones. It scoops the stuffing out of us, and chucks us aside. Alas!",David Herbert Lawrence,art
"Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love.",Claude Monet,art
"In its most limited sense, modern, art would seem to concern itself only with the technical innovations of the period.",Edward Hopper,art
The question of the value of nationality in art is perhaps unsolvable.,Edward Hopper,art
"The trend in some of the contemporary movements in art, but by no means all, seems to deny this ideal and to me appears to lead to a purely decorative conception of painting.",Edward Hopper,art
"Life is short, the art long.",Hippocrates,art
Everything that has ever been called folk art has always reflected domination.,Theodor Adorno,art
"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.",Charlie Parker,art
My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I've been pursuing all my life.,Paul Cezanne,art
Don't be an art critic. Paint. There lies salvation.,Paul Cezanne,art
"Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level and enjoy it, but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and persistence that any art form does.",Walter Murch,art
Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man's starving!,O. Henry,art
"It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.",Ezra Pound,art
"It is not in life, but in art that self-fulfillment is to be found.",Wilson Mizner,art
Art lies by its own artifice.,Ovid,art
"Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth.",Publilius Syrus,art
Art and works of art do not make an artist sense and enthusiasm and instinct do.,Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel,art
"You can't but know that if you can capture the emotions of the audience as well as their minds, the play will work better, because it's a narrative art form.",Tom Stoppard,art
Teachers believe they have a gift for giving it drives them with the same irrepressible drive that drives others to create a work of art or a market or a building.,A. Bartlett Giamatti,art
"The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art.",John Lasseter,art
"To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art - that is, intimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the infinite, expressed by every means available to the arts.",Charles Baudelaire,art
"What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life.",Michel Foucault,art
"Art is so subjective, and people can react however they want.",Jennifer Aniston,art
"I'm free. I just do what I want, say what I want, say how I feel, and I don't try to hurt nobody. I just try to make sure that I don't compromise my art in any kind of way, and I think people respect that.",Erykah Badu,art
Rumors sound of galleries asking artists for upsized art and more of it. I've heard of photographers asked to print larger to increase the wall power and salability of their work. Everything winds up set to maximum in order to feed the beast.,Jerry Saltz,art
"To engage with art, we have to be willing to be wrong, venture outside our psychic comfort zones, suspend disbelief, and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art.",Jerry Saltz,art
I can't bear art that you can walk round and admire. A book should be either a bandit or a rebel or a man in the crowd.,David Herbert Lawrence,art
"Since obscenity is the truth of our passion today, it is the only stuff of art - or almost the only stuff.",David Herbert Lawrence,art
"The essential function of art is moral. But a passionate, implicit morality, not didactic. A morality which changes the blood, rather than the mind.",David Herbert Lawrence,art
I am more a friend of art than a producer of painting.,Paul Cezanne,art
You say a new era in art is preparing you sensed it coming continue your studies without weakening. God will do the rest.,Paul Cezanne,art
I have nothing to hide in art. The initial force alone can bring anyone to the end he must attain.,Paul Cezanne,art
Is art really the priesthood that demands the pure in heart who belong to it wholly?,Paul Cezanne,art
A frenzied passion for art is a canker that devours everything else.,Charles Baudelaire,art
"Evil is done without effort, naturally, it is the working of fate good is always the product of an art.",Charles Baudelaire,art
"I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon.",Sydney Pollack,art
The art of living is the art of knowing how to believe lies.,Cesare Pavese,art
"Let's talk of a system that transforms all the social organisms into a work of art, in which the entire process of work is included... something in which the principle of production and consumption takes on a form of quality. It's a Gigantic project.",Joseph Beuys,art
Any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience.,Rebecca West,art
"History repeats itself, but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced. It is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird.",Joseph Conrad,art
"One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on.",Danica McKellar,art
"A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above, and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.",Clive Bell,art
"It was Public Art, defined as art that is purchased by experts who are not spending their own personal money.",Dave Barry,art
"Art is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love - to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved.",Isadora Duncan,art
"Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art.",William Bernbach,art
I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.',Lady Gaga,art
"Medicine is not only a science it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.",Paracelsus,art
I would no more quarrel with a man because of his religion than I would because of his art.,Mary Baker Eddy,art
"So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die that is to say, civilization will die.",William Morris,art
Poor Georgia O'Keeffe. Death didn't soften the opinions of the art world toward her paintings.,Jerry Saltz,art
I've always said that an art critic can put aside politics around art.,Jerry Saltz,art

"Art is changing. Again. Here. Now. Opportunities to witness this are rare, so attend and observe.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Art is good, bad, boring, ugly, useful to us or not.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Recessions are hard on people, but they are not hard on art.",Jerry Saltz,art
I like that the art world isn't regulated.,Jerry Saltz,art
The art world is molting - some would say melting. Galleries are closing museums are scaling back.,Jerry Saltz,art
"Almost all institutions own a lot more art than they can ever show, much of it revealing for its timeliness, genius, or sheer weirdness.",Jerry Saltz,art
"The forties, seventies, and the nineties, when money was scarce, were great periods, when the art world retracted but it was also reborn.",Jerry Saltz,art
Robert Rauschenberg was not a giant of American art he was the giant. No American created so many aesthetic openings for so many artists.,Jerry Saltz,art
The Met is not only the finest encyclopedic museum of art in the United States it is arguably the finest anywhere.,Jerry Saltz,art
Money is something that can be measured art is not. It's all subjective.,Jerry Saltz,art
"Contrary to popular opinion, things don't go stale particularly fast in the art world.",Jerry Saltz,art
Art usually only makes the news in America when the subject is money.,Jerry Saltz,art
I hate art auctions.,Jerry Saltz,art
"The price of a work of art has nothing to do with what the work of art is, can do, or is worth on an existential, alchemical level.",Jerry Saltz,art
"To me, nothing in the art world is neutral. The idea of 'disinterest' strikes me as boring, dishonest, dubious, and uninteresting.",Jerry Saltz,art
"The art world is an all-volunteer force. No one has to be here if he or she doesn't want to be, and we should be associating with anyone we want to.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Wolfgang Tillman's stunning large-scale pictures, being shown for the first time, were so offhand I failed to see them as art.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies, when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in.",Jerry Saltz,art
"There's something pleasing about large, well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.",Jerry Saltz,art
"First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.",Jerry Saltz,art
Not to say people shouldn't get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.,Jerry Saltz,art
"These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I'm a flesh-eating virus.",Jerry Saltz,art
"In art, scandal is a false narrative, a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don't know what we're seeing, we overreact.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism.",Jerry Saltz,art
Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There's likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam's or Hamburg's galleries.,Jerry Saltz,art
"Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn't any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Imagine it's 1981. You're an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You're also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn't that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off.",Jerry Saltz,art
"I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn's work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn't simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved 'isms' and twists.",Jerry Saltz,art
"It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He's the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.",Jerry Saltz,art
The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city's magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.,Jerry Saltz,art
Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you'll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).,Jerry Saltz,art
"My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.",Jerry Saltz,art
"I'm noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum's 'Younger Than Jesus' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I'm seeing it blossom and bear fruit at 'Greater New York,' MoMA P.S. 1's twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.",Jerry Saltz,art
"It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn't own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.",Jerry Saltz,art
"All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy.",Jerry Saltz,art
Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.,Jerry Saltz,art
"Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you'll find it. It's there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.",Jerry Saltz,art
"After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it's now close to aesthetic kudzu.",Jerry Saltz,art
"The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we're not pure enough, good omens appear.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don't seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist's work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there's something wrong with the art.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.",Jerry Saltz,art
"It's great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.",Jerry Saltz,art
"The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer's journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It's not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.",Jerry Saltz,art
"It's art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn't about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - 'contain multitudes.'",Jerry Saltz,art
"The last time money left the art world, intrepid types maxed out their credit cards and opened galleries, and a few of them have become the best in the world.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren't virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won't have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They'll be able to experiment as much as they want.",Jerry Saltz,art
"While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It's not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It's a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship.",Jerry Saltz,art
"When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.' All this flashy 'art-fair art' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.",Jerry Saltz,art
"A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.",Jerry Saltz,art
"If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.",Jerry Saltz,art
"A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.",Jerry Saltz,art
"It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino's work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.",Jerry Saltz,art
"'Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.",Jerry Saltz,art
"A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.",Jerry Saltz,art
"The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.",Jerry Saltz,art
"'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.",Jerry Saltz,art
Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.,Jerry Saltz,art
Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.,Jerry Saltz,art
"The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.",Jerry Saltz,art
"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.",Jerry Saltz,art
"If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.",Jerry Saltz,art
"I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.",Jerry Saltz,art
"A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.",Jerry Saltz,art
"I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.",Jerry Saltz,art
"I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.",Jerry Saltz,art
"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.",Jerry Saltz,art
"I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.",Jerry Saltz,art
"Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).",Jerry Saltz,art
Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.,Jerry Saltz,art
Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.,Jerry Saltz,art
"We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.",Jerry Saltz,art
Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.,Jean Cocteau,art
I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.,Jean-Michel Basquiat,art
"To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.",Vladimir Nabokov,art
Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.,William Shatner,art
Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.,Catherine Deneuve,art
"Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.",Camille Paglia,art
Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.,Maynard James Keenan,art
Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.,Paul Valery,art
"What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.",W. H. Auden,art
"Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.",Alanis Morissette,art
Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.,Jean Cocteau,art
Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.,James Joyce,art
"As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.",Thomas Guthrie,art
The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.,Gustave Flaubert,art
"Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.",Gustave Flaubert,art
"You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.",Gustave Flaubert,art
"There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.",Gustave Flaubert,art
The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.,Gustave Flaubert,art
The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.,Gustave Flaubert,art
