"I think opera has gained a kind of glamorous appeal.

I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic.

"Ooh, it's too embarrassing to share my innermost romantic secrets - although I have written Danielle the odd poem. If anything they are more comedic than romantic.

Being in the studio is a really romantic time.,Alison Krauss,romantic
"Movies don't look hard, but figuring it out, getting the shape of it, getting everybody's character right and having it be funny, make sense and be romantic, it's creating a puzzle. Yes, having been a writer for so long, I have an awareness of when things are going awry, but it doesn't mean I know how to fix them.",Nancy Meyers,romantic
"Times were changing. Clothes were changing. Morals were changing. We went from romantic loves songs like I used to do to rock 'n roll. Now that has changed to rap. So, there's always a new generation with new music.",Bobby Vinton,romantic
"When I read the script, I liked the script very much and I thought it was a marvelous part for her, because I think it is a change of pace. I mean, we know how wonderful she is in romantic comedy.",Albert Finney,romantic

"I don't know if it's a romantic comedy but I'm in the beginning of the first of the season of 'The West Wing.' We shot it last year. I don't know. If anyone asks me to be in one, I'll jump on it.",Jason Isaacs,romantic

If we perform the romantic repertoire we need more musicians.,Neville Marriner,romantic
"The thing you can't let go of is gravity. The reality of gravity in writing.

"I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, believe it or not.",Kate Hudson,romantic
"I really, really, really want to do a silly romantic comedy where I can just have a crush on the guy, trip over myself, and laugh and be goofy. I just feel like all I do is cry, sob, and fight zombies and the bad guys.",Laurie Holden,romantic
