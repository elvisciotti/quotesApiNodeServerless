"When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life.

But only a little.",Miuccia Prada,design
"I mean, I think about it, but I don't design my record to get a certain public response.",Liz Phair,design

"I've wanted to design golf courses ever since I was a kid. I suppose it comes from the way I've played the game. To find the proper way to play any hole, I've always begun by asking myself what the architect has tried to do with it.",Jack Nicklaus,design
"A Nicklaus Design golf course is done by the guys in my company that I work with, that have been trained in my vision, and they do what they think I might do.
