"Part of my job as a food writer is to describe food. So my work on 'Top Chef,' I feel, is an extension of that. When we give a criticism to the contestant, we want to make sure we tell them why it's not working and why it would work if they did it a different way.",Padma Lakshmi,food

I admire idealists, but they're usually enabled by someone who holds the tether on their balloon, who pays the bills and sweeps up after them.",Geraldine Brooks,food
"Especially for me, growing up in such a small town in the middle of nowhere, the desire to be away was incredible.

"It makes sense that we came up with our public school system during the Industrial Revolution because it's like everybody is a factory worker, eating their terrible food and going back to the room where you're silent and listening to an idiot. That's an epitomizing idea, getting called 'Nothing' for your whole high school experience.",Ezra Miller,food
"Doing things like playing music, something that's so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food.
