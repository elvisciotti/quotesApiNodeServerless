Poetry is the language we speak in the most terrifying or ecstatic passages of our lives. But the very word poetry scares people. They think of their grade school teachers reciting 'Hiawatha' and they groan.,Erica Jong,poetry
I thought to spend my declining years writing poetry and teaching - but that won't pay the Bergdorf's bill. I think I'll move to somewhere life is cheaper.,Erica Jong,poetry

"You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses. These people that tortured my life were using my art, my poetry, as fuel for them, to torture other people.",Fred Durst,poetry
"Poetry is adolescence fermented, and thus preserved.",Jose Ortega y Gasset,poetry

Poetry and music are very good friends. Like mommies and daddies and strawberries and cream - they go together.,Nikki Giovanni,poetry

"Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.",Aung San Suu Kyi,poetry

"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.",Wilfred Owen,poetry

A lot happens by accident in poetry.,Howard Nemerov,poetry

Poetry is the deification of reality.,Edith Sitwell,poetry
"While also, importantly, not wanting to dumb it down or pretend the days of 'difficult' poetry are over, because we live in a pluralist culture and there's room for 'difficult' poetry alongside rap and everything else.

Poetic talent doesn't operate in a vacuum. There is a spirit of Polish poetry.,Wislawa Szymborska,poetry

"Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.",Wislawa Szymborska,poetry
"In the language of poetry, where every word is weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it. And above all, not a single existence, not anyone's existence in this world.",Wislawa Szymborska,poetry
"Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.",Wislawa Szymborska,poetry

"A public expectation, it has to be said, not of poetry as such but of political positions variously approvable by mutually disapproving groups.",Seamus Heaney,poetry

There may be more poetry than justice in poetic justice.,George Will,poetry
Translation is an interestingly different way to be involved both with poetry and with the language that I've found myself living in much of the time. I think the two feed each other.,Marilyn Hacker,poetry

"Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.",Terry Eagleton,poetry
"Poetry is the most subtle of the literary arts, and students grow more ingenious by the year at avoiding it. If they can nip around Milton, duck under Blake and collapse gratefully into the arms of Jane Austen, a lot of them will.",Terry Eagleton,poetry
I think that it's more likely that in my 60s and 70s I will be writing poetry rather than fiction.,Robert Morgan,poetry

Among the American contemporaries I read with most enjoyment are several North Carolinians. I think the best poetry being written these days is being written by Southerners.,Robert Morgan,poetry
The Language Poets are writing only about language itself. The Ashbery poets are writing only about poetry itself. That seems to me a kind of dead end.,Robert Morgan,poetry
"Our most famous writers are Faulkner and Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor. It would make sense that the poetry would reflect some of those same values, some of the same techniques.",Robert Morgan,poetry
"Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.",Robert Morgan,poetry
The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.,Robert Morgan,poetry
"Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.",Robert Morgan,poetry

"Some people swear by writing courses, but whether it really helps American poetry, I have doubts.",Robert Morgan,poetry
"I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.",Robert Morgan,poetry
"I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.",Robert Morgan,poetry
"One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.",Robert Morgan,poetry

The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.,Robert Morgan,poetry
"What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.",Robert Morgan,poetry
"The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.",Robert Morgan,poetry
"Part of what we love about poetry is the fact that it seems ancient, that it has an authority of ancient language and ancient form, and that it's timeless, that it reaches back.",Robert Morgan,poetry
The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.,Robert Morgan,poetry

Poetry is truth in its Sunday clothes.,Joseph Roux,poetry
"I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write.",Colin Quinn,poetry
"But one does not make living writing poetry unless you're a professor, and one frankly doesn't get a lot of girls as a poet.",Jeffery Deaver,poetry
"With Shakespeare and poetry, a new world was born. New dreams, new desires, a self consciousness was born. I desired to know to know myself in terms of the new standards set by these books.",Peter Abrahams,poetry

It's like I understand images and some people understand poetry.,Samantha Morton,poetry
"Poetry is a mere drug, Sir.",George Farquhar,poetry
"I have piles of poetry books in the bathroom, on the stairs, everywhere. The only way to write poetry is to read it.",Carol Ann Duffy,poetry
You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.,Mario Cuomo,poetry
"Those who say we should dismantle the role of Poet Laureate altogether, the trick they miss is that being called this thing, with the weight of tradition behind it, and with the association of the Royal family, does allow you to have conversations and to open doors, and wallets, for the good of poetry in a way that nothing else would allow.",Andrew Motion,poetry
"Poetry is at the centre of my life, too, emotionally speaking, and intellectually speaking - it's just that I'm one of those people who enjoy doing other stuff as well.",Andrew Motion,poetry
"I'm not precisely saying that a really good board meeting at the MLA (Museums, Libraries and Archives Coucil) makes me want to go and write poetry, but there is a pleasure in doing that sort of thing well.",Andrew Motion,poetry
"In a general way, I want to be a kind of flag-waver, bunting hanger-up, drum-beater, you name it, for poetry.",Andrew Motion,poetry
"Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos.",Andrew Motion,poetry
"I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry.",Andrew Motion,poetry
More people are reading poetry now than at any time in the history of the human race.,Andrew Motion,poetry
"Poetry is a special use of language that opens onto the real. The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet.",Huston Smith,poetry
"This is a good time to ask apologists for the Islamic regime, who degrades Islam? Who imposes stoning, forced marriage of underage girls and flogging for not wearing the veil? Do such practices represent Iran's ancient history and culture, its ethnic and religious diversity? Its centuries of sensual and subversive poetry?",Azar Nafisi,poetry
Poetry and consumption are the most flattering of diseases.,William Shenstone,poetry

"A very intimate sense of the expressiveness of outward things, which ponders, listens, penetrates, where the earlier, less developed consciousness passed lightly by, is an important element in the general temper of our modern poetry.",Walter Pater,poetry
"That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.",Walter Pater,poetry
"Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it.",Walter Pater,poetry
"Such discussions help us very little to enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate between what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use words like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise meaning than they would otherwise have.",Walter Pater,poetry
"I wrote some bad poetry that I published in North African journals, but even as I withdrew into this reading, I also led the life of a kind of young hooligan.",Jacques Derrida,poetry
"All those authors there, most of whom of course I've never met. That's the poetry side, that's the prose side, that's the fishing and miscellaneous behind me. You get an affection for books that you've enjoyed.",Norman MacCaig,poetry
"And if they haven't got poetry in them, there's nothing you can do that will produce it.",Norman MacCaig,poetry
"And the second question, can poetry be taught? I didn't think so.",Norman MacCaig,poetry

I never think about poetry except when I'm writing it. I mean my poetry.,Norman MacCaig,poetry
I was very interested in American poetry for many years. Much less now.,Norman MacCaig,poetry
"In fact a lot of them I think are absolute baloney. Those Charles Olsens and people like that. At first I was interested in seeing what they were up to, what they were doing, why they were doing it. They never moved me in the way that one is moved by true poetry.",Norman MacCaig,poetry
"When I was asked to be Writer in Residence at Edinburgh I thought, you can't teach poetry. This is ridiculous.",Norman MacCaig,poetry

The quietest poetry can be an explosion of joy.,James Broughton,poetry
"For me, prose walks, poetry dances.",James Broughton,poetry
"Poetry is a natural energy resource of our country.It has no energy crisis, possessing a potential that will last as long as the country. Its power is equal to that of any country in the world.",Richard Eberhart,poetry
"However, poetry does not live solely in books or in school anthologies.",Eugenio Montale,poetry
I do not go in search of poetry. I wait for poetry to visit me.,Eugenio Montale,poetry
"Narrative art, the novel, from Murasaki to Proust, has produced great works of poetry.",Eugenio Montale,poetry
Poetry is the art which is technically within the grasp of everyone: a piece of paper and a pencil and one is ready.,Eugenio Montale,poetry
"Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.",Eugenio Montale,poetry
There is also poetry written to be shouted in a square in front of an enthusiastic crowd. This occurs especially in countries where authoritarian regimes are in power.,Eugenio Montale,poetry

"I know I'm not a wordsmith. And I don't write poetry. Sometimes I think I should, because it's really helpful. But I always wanted to write novels.",Candace Bushnell,poetry

"A lot of people think, 'I'll give acting or poetry or filmmaking a try. And if it doesn't work out I'll go get a law degree, do something else that's more practical.' For me I went the reverse way. I lived the back-up plan.",Brit Marling,poetry
I come here to speak poetry. It will always be in the grass. It will also be necessary to bend down to hear it. It will always be too simple to be discussed in assemblies.,Boris Pasternak,poetry
I don't write poetry and then strum some chords and then fit the words on top of the chords.,Andrew Bird,poetry

"A book is sent out into the world, and there is no way of fully anticipating the responses it will elicit. Consider the responses called forth by the Bible, Homer, Shakespeare - let alone contemporary poetry or a modern novel.",Chaim Potok,poetry
"Perhaps there is an idea among Japanese students that one general difference between Japanese and Western poetry is that the former cultivates short forms and the latter longer ones, gut this is only in part true.",Lafcadio Hearn,poetry
It is true that short forms of poetry have been cultivated in the Far East more than in modern Europe but in all European literature short forms of poetry are to be found - indeed quite as short as anything in Japanese.,Lafcadio Hearn,poetry
I often imagine that the longer he studies English literature the more the Japanese student must be astonished at the extraordinary predominance given to the passion of love both in fiction and in poetry.,Lafcadio Hearn,poetry

"Journalism is concerned with events, poetry with feelings. Journalism is concerned with the look of the world, poetry with the feel of the world.",Archibald MacLeish,poetry

The tradition of Russian literature is also an eastern tradition of learning poetry and prose by heart.,Ryszard Kapuscinski,poetry
"I don't think you get to good writing unless you expose yourself and your feelings. Deep songs don't come from the surface they come from the deep down. The poetry and the songs that you are suppose to write, I believe are in your heart.",Judy Collins,poetry
"A group of us started a community center in Santa Monica. We've tried different programs, and three have worked really well. A poetry group. Once a week we visit Venice High and talk to girls at risk.",Lisa Bonet,poetry

"It's just poetry, beauty and love. How hard can that be to act?",Robin Wright Penn,poetry
"I have experienced healing through other writers' poetry, but there's no way I can sit down to write in the hope a poem will have healing potential. If I do, I'll write a bad poem.",Marilyn Hacker,poetry
"When you translate poetry in particular, you're obliged to look at how the writer with whom you're working puts together words, sentences, phrases, the triple tension between the line of verse, the syntax and the sentence.",Marilyn Hacker,poetry
"Poetry seems to have been eliminated as a literary genre, and installed instead, as a kind of spiritual aerobic exercise - nobody need read it, but anybody can do it.",Marilyn Hacker,poetry

"There are better ways we can transform this virulent hatred - by living our ideals, the Peace Corps, exchange students, teachers, exporting our music, poetry, blue jeans.",Helen Thomas,poetry
"It is the timber of poetry that wears most surely, and there is no timber that has not strong roots among the clay and worms.",John Millington Synge,poetry
"I think it comes from really liking literary forms. Poetry is very beautiful, but the space on the page can be as affecting as where the text is. Like when Miles Davis doesn't play, it has a poignancy to it.",Jim Jarmusch,poetry
"If you go into a bar in most places in America and even say the word poetry, you'll probably get beaten up. But poetry is a really strong, beautiful form to me, and a lot of innovation in language comes from poetry.",Jim Jarmusch,poetry
"I work on words, mostly, toward them being poetry or short stories, and then some of those become songs. They all find their place in the world, but they all start off in the same place. I'm always painting and drawing as well, and it's an ongoing creative assignment.",P. J. Harvey,poetry

"When I really want to be soothed and reminded of why people bother to fiddle with sentences, I often read poetry.",Nicholson Baker,poetry
"From my music training, I knew that, some Spanish rhythms apart, 5/4 is a time signature used only in the modern era. Holst's Mars from the Planets is 5/4. But if you speak lines of poetry in that pattern you just end up hitting the off-beats. It's only when you add a rest - a sixth beat - that it sounds as it surely should sound.",Nicholson Baker,poetry
"So I really began as a failed poet - although when I first wanted to be a writer, I learned to write prose by reading poetry.",Nicholson Baker,poetry

"I guess the two Manifesto, Communicating Vessels, Mad Love, and some of his poetry made a significant mark on me but as far as bringing a literary element into the music I see it as a much broader assimilation.",Trevor Dunn,poetry
"Even if you only want to write science fiction, you should also read mysteries, poetry, mainstream literature, history, biography, philosophy, and science.",Walter Jon Williams,poetry

More people than ever are slowly but surely turning their ears toward poetry.,Saul Williams,poetry

"On the other hand, if there's an underlying core of poetry that I go to, I go to the sea. I've lived on the sea all my life. I live on the sea in Cape Breton.",Richard Serra,poetry

"There have been two popular subjects for poetry in the last few decades: the Vietnam War and AIDS, about both of which almost all of us have felt deeply.",Thom Gunn,poetry
"And I know I'm supposed to feel guilty for wanting people to buy my books... and books in general? Novels and poetry, they belong to the realm of art. How dirty of us to try to hawk art!

"I'm perfectly happy when I look out at an audience and it's all women. I always think it's kind of odd, but then, more women than men, I think, read and write poetry.",Diane Wakoski,poetry

"I believe that all poetry is formal in that it exists within limits, limits that are either inherited by tradition or limits that language itself imposes.",Mark Strand,poetry
"And yet, in a culture like ours, which is given to material comforts, and addicted to forms of entertainment that offer immediate gratification, it is surprising that so much poetry is written.",Mark Strand,poetry
"And at least in poetry you should feel free to lie. That is, not to lie, but to imagine what you want, to follow the direction of the poem.",Mark Strand,poetry
"A life is not sufficiently elevated for poetry, unless, of course, the life has been made into an art.",Mark Strand,poetry

"Well, I had this little notion - I started writing when I was eleven, writing poetry. I was passionately addicted to it it was my great refuge through adolescence.",Harry Mathews,poetry
"My next project is to get back to that. Actually, to learn how to write poetry. I'm not kidding.",Harry Mathews,poetry
"Even the people who have had success and made money writing these books of fiction seem to feel the need to pretend it's no big deal, or part of a natural progression from poetry to fiction, but often it's really just about the money, the perceived prestige.",George Murray,poetry
"Humour is a fine line to walk in poetry, as in fiction. I just think it's harder to write. It's harder to keep the respect of the reader too.",George Murray,poetry

The poetry community here has been extraordinarily welcoming.,George Murray,poetry
Then I discovered I loved writing poetry more than fiction.,George Murray,poetry
"Writing poetry makes you intensely conscious of how words sound, both aloud and inside the head of the reader. You learn the weight of words and how they sound to the ear.",Helen Dunmore,poetry
"I've always written. When I was in school, the only teacher who ever liked me was my creative writing teacher. I used to enter poetry competitions, and I don't think I ever lost one. So I had the idea for a while of being some kind of poet.",Justin Townes Earle,poetry
"I heard Nirvana, and discovered that songs could be like poetry, but a little bit more refined: you didn't have to have 20 verses to get your point across.",Justin Townes Earle,poetry

"I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.",Shelby Foote,poetry

"As for political poetry, as it's usually defined, it seems there's very little good political poetry.",Kenneth Koch,poetry
"I love painting and music, of course. I don't know nearly as much about them as I know about poetry. I've certainly been influenced by fiction. I was overwhelmed by War and Peace when I read it, and I didn't read it until I was in my late 20s.",Kenneth Koch,poetry

I have always written poetry but I have never applied it to songwriting.,Janine Turner,poetry
"We all need ways to express ourselves, and poetry is one of mine.",Jack Prelutsky,poetry

Poetry is at least an elegance and at most a revelation.,Robert Fitzgerald,poetry

"Poetry leads us to the unstructured sources of our beings, to the unknown, and returns us to our rational, structured selves refreshed.",A. R. Ammons,poetry

"Besides the actual reading in class of many poems, I would suggest you do two things: first, while teaching everything you can and keeping free of it, teach that poetry is a mode of discourse that differs from logical exposition.",A. R. Ammons,poetry

"That's one of the great things about poetry one realises that one does one's little turn - that you're just part of the great crop, as it were.",Paul Muldoon,poetry
"The other side of it is that, despite all that, people reach out to poetry at the key moments in their lives.",Paul Muldoon,poetry

"I guess I wanted to leave America for awhile. It wasn't that I wanted to become an expatriate, or just never come back, I needed some breathing room. I'd already been translating French poetry, I'd been to Paris once before and liked it very much, and so I just went.",Paul Auster,poetry
