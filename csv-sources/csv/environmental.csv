We have fought for social justice. We have fought for economic justice. We have fought for environmental justice. We have fought for criminal justice. Now we must add a new fight - the fight for electoral justice.,Barbara Boxer,environmental
"I am going to confront the old-fashioned negative thinking which says that all government needs to do to generate growth is cut worker and environmental protections, cut taxes on the rich and stroke 'fat cats' until they purr with pleasure. I'm completely repudiating the idea that government has to get out of the way.",Vince Cable,environmental
We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.,Andrew Weil,environmental

Have we failed to slow global warming pollution in part because climate and environmental activists have been too polite and well behaved?,Jeff Goodell,environmental

The position I took at the time was that we hadn't really examined any of the potential environmental consequences of introducing genetically modified organisms.,Jeremy Rifkin,environmental

You cannot achieve environmental security and human development without addressing the basic issues of health and nutrition.,Gro Harlem Brundtland,environmental
I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can't be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.,Jello Biafra,environmental
