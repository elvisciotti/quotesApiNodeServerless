"My personality, when tasked with creating meals, goes something like this: Is there a way we can make this more difficult? Because let's do that. I don't mean to complicate things.

I've done the most awful rubbish in order to have somewhere to go in the morning.,Richard Burton,morning
"What is news? It's hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely, and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news, except to tell you what happened overnight, and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It's harder to be an educated and informed citizen.",Harrison Ford,morning
"The average, healthy, well-adjusted adult gets up at seven-thirty in the morning feeling just plain terrible.",Jean Kerr,morning
