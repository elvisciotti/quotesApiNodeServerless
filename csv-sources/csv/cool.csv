I'd wear flip-flops and jeans. I guess that's not cool.,Bill Rancic,cool

"When you have kids, you just love them. It's similar to when you're in love with someone.

I love almost all of the characters I've played.",Alanna Ubach,cool
"That wasn't the way that things was supposed to be.

I liked the name Frog Brigade because it lent itself to a lot of cool imagery with the whole frog thing.,Les Claypool,cool
"I have this desire to just while away weeks, months and years.

Spiderman can climb walls and he's got a cool outfit.,Rhona Mitra,cool
"I am kind of a private person, so I don't miss that part of show business at all.

"I was a dancer, and it's not really cool for a boy to dance, so it was inspiring to see a movie like 'Footloose' where a guy is dancing masculine and had a proper reason behind it.

"With these men and women who work-for the cause with all their hearts, with cool heads and skilled hands we will master every fate.",Gustav Krupp,cool
Atlanta is an incredibly cool city.,Andrew Lincoln,cool
"I liked the way my character, Shane, was first introduced. You get introduced to her through this sexual action, and I thought that was so cool and just kind of summed up what she enjoys and who she is, to a certain extent. She's a complete sexual being and the great thing is that she doesn't apologize for it. It's just who she is. We rarely see women be able to do that on television.",Katherine Moennig,cool

"Well, I look at it like this: When you go to a restaurant, the less you know about what happens in the kitchen, the more you enjoy your meal. If the soup tastes good, everything's cool, and you don't necessarily want to know what's in it. The same thing holds true with movies.",Jeffrey Wright,cool
"It's really cool to know that you've put something together that isn't for a particular audience. It's so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population, and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.",David Krumholtz,cool
"I've always been into guitars... we want to put keyboards on, but keyboard players don't look cool onstage, they just keep their heads down. There has never been a cool keyboard player, apart from Elton John.",Noel Gallagher,cool

"White people couldn't do black music back in the day because they weren't funky or bad enough. They weren't from the ghettoes, but hip-hop and R&ampB changed all of that because white kids want to be down with it. They wanted to learn it so they studied the culture.

That show's finished and I don't know why it ended, so it was brilliant to go into 'Being Human,' which is like the adult version of it.",Craig Roberts,cool
"I'd love to pop back into 'Being Human' as Adam. I love the character so much. I've never really played a character like that. I'm always playing the geek, so to play a kid who is very energetic when he wants to be, and who is always trying to get the girls, was really cool.",Craig Roberts,cool
