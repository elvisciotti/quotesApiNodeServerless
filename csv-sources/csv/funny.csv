I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice.

"I think there have always been funny women, from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman, they innately know she's worked twice as hard to get there, she's had to prove that she can be the leader, first, and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she's in control.",Wendy Liebman,funny

"Here is my prescription to heal all wounds. Watch the film 'Funny Girl' at least five times, eat at least 45 chocolate bars, and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex.

I don't just try to be funny.,Bil Keane,funny
"It's harder to be funny if you're handsome than if you're very normal-looking. It's just more relatable. You're the underdog.

"I think we're the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It's not a joke show.

What you don't want is funny scene, funny scene, funny scene, and now here's the epiphany scene and then the movie's over.",Paul Feig,funny
Women's humor seems to be a little more supportive. It's just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that. I feel less like I'm going to get beat up in a room full of women than I do in a room full of guys.,Paul Feig,funny

You have to pretend it doesn't hurt.",Chris Pratt,funny
It's a funny relationship that makeup artists have. I always feel kind of like a dentist. People look at me and think of pain.,Rick Baker,funny
"I love Charlie, Billy Burke's character. Writing for him is so spectacular, he's so funny and wry and every scene he's in he just takes. There's a scene in 'Eclipse' where Bella tells him she's a virgin, and it's the funniest, most awkward scene I've ever seen on film.",Melissa Rosenberg,funny
"It's funny how I use social media because I don't use it to promote my restaurants that much. I use it for social issues and I think that's what it's for.

"It's funny, because when you're younger you're in a rush to be 18 or 21 or whatever. But then you hit 30. And now, the days go by like hours. You think, 40, man, this could be the halfway point. It could be the three-quarters point, you know? Who knows?",Mark Wahlberg,funny

"Scream was great for what it was. For a horror film, it was intelligent, it was funny, it took a laugh at itself.",Neve Campbell,funny
"When I was a kid, I wanted to be serious, like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor, do they? Now I realise how stupid that is - and it's because comic acting isn't taken seriously enough. It's a discipline. You know instantly - either you're funny and getting the laughs, or you're not.",Chris O'Dowd,funny
I think there's something in the fact that it's hard to be good looking and funny. You have to have an oddball quality people have to sympathise with you to find you funny.,Chris O'Dowd,funny

It's funny that I got to do 'On the Road' because the thing that had the biggest impact on me growing up was reading books. I was very inspired by the book and this spirit of Dean Moriarty and how envious we all are of somebody who can be that carefree.,Garrett Hedlund,funny
"It's funny - I read that women look to chiseled-faced guys for one-night stands, and to round-faced guys for marriage. When I'm rounder in the face, I like to say, 'This is my long-term look.' Or 'This is my wife-and-kids look right here.'",Garrett Hedlund,funny
"This is the great thing about Northern Ireland. I walk down the street and people stop me and say things like, 'I know you. You're that wee golfer, aren't you?' I say, 'Yeah, that's me.'

We want to be funny. We want to make people laugh... We'll do whatever it takes.,Colin Mochrie,funny
"But, sooner or later I'd love to do a comedy.

I love nerds. Comic-Con junkies are the tastemakers of tomorrow. Isn't that funny? The tables have turned.,Kristen Bell,funny

"Being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in.",Hank Azaria,funny

"If people want to compete for leadership of a religious group, they can compete in piety. A chilling thought. Or funny.",Mary Douglas,funny
"Back in the '70s, like one of my favorite movies ever was 'The Bad News Bears', and that was a kids' movie, but I don't think of it that way. I think of it as just a great movie because Walter Matthau was so funny and so harsh with those kids.",Jack Black,funny

One can always come up with funny lists and jokes. You know what? I take it back. Not everyone can always come up with funny lists and some jokes. I'm very lucky to have a gift where I can do that pretty ably.,John Hodgman,funny
"People forget how outcast 'They Might Be Giants' can be. They have a reputation for writing really deft, funny, clever melodies, and they also make a lot of music for kids, which is terrific, but when you see them in concert, they can rock the house.",John Hodgman,funny
"It's so funny looking back, but my so-called overnight success actually took 15 years. I remember when I didn't have any money, and my only car was mom's Hyundai.",Criss Angel,funny

I think it's really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there. It's funny to me that we're expected to keep quiet just because of who we are. Why do I lose my right to speak my mind because I'm famous?,Lisa Edelstein,funny
"I'm not a movie guy, I'm not a TV sitcom guy, but whatever seems to fit and is funny is good for me.",Dave Attell,funny
"You have to understand the tone of the movie, because if it's supposed to be funny, it can be funny violent like the Home Alone stuff, but you have to really understand the tone of what you're doing and make the action work for that and for the character.",David R. Ellis,funny

"To this day, I've found that it doesn't matter what a guy looks like if he's really funny. His sense of humor makes him attractive. On the other hand, you don't hear men saying, 'No she's not pretty, but is she ever funny!'",Catherine O'Hara,funny
"Everything seems fine until you're about 40. Then something is definitely beginning to go wrong. And you look in the mirror with your old habit of thinking, 'While I accept that everyone grows old and dies, it's a funny thing, but I'm an exception to that rule.'",Martin Amis,funny

"I don't think of myself as a comedian, but as an artist, a scientist and chemist who just happens to be funny. I started doing stand-up to add another level to my game. I feel that I'm a young rookie with a veteran's skill.",Marlon Wayans,funny
